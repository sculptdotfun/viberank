## Getting Started

### Submitting Your Usage Data

#### Option 1: Using the viberank CLI (Recommended)

The easiest way to submit your usage data:

```bash
npx viberank
```

This will:
- Automatically detect your GitHub username from git config
- Generate your usage data using ccusage
- Submit it to the leaderboard
- Give you a direct link to your profile

#### Option 2: MCP Server (for Claude Desktop)

If you're using Claude Desktop or another MCP-compatible client, you can use our MCP server for seamless integration:

```json
// Add to ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "viberank": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["viberank-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then just ask Claude: "Submit my usage stats to Viberank"

#### Option 3: Using curl

If you prefer to use curl directly:

```bash
# Generate usage data
npx ccusage@latest --json > cc.json

# Get your GitHub username
GITHUB_USER=$(git config user.name)

# Submit to viberank
curl -X POST https://www.viberank.app/api/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-User: $GITHUB_USER" \
  -d @cc.json
```

#### Option 4: Web Upload

1. Visit [viberank.app](https://viberank.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "Submit Your Stats"
4. Upload your `cc.json` file

### Profile Pages

Every user gets a beautiful profile page at `viberank.app/profile/{github-username}` featuring:

- üìä **Usage Chart** - Interactive area chart showing daily costs over time
- üìà **Statistics** - Total cost, tokens, days active, and averages
- üìù **Submission History** - Detailed breakdown of all submissions
- üè∑Ô∏è **Model Usage** - See which Claude models you use most
- üîó **GitHub Integration** - Links to your GitHub profile

### Data Validation & Fair Play

To maintain leaderboard integrity, viberank validates all submissions:

#### Automatic Validation
- ‚úÖ **Token math verification** - Ensures input + output + cache tokens = total
- ‚úÖ **Negative value check** - Rejects any negative values
- ‚úÖ **Date validation** - No future dates allowed
- ‚úÖ **Realistic limits** - Flags unusually high usage for review

#### Validation Limits
- Maximum daily cost: $5,000
- Maximum daily tokens: 250 million
- Cost per token ratio: 0.000001 to 0.1

Submissions exceeding these limits are flagged for review and hidden from the main leaderboard to ensure fair competition.

### Multiple Submissions

viberank intelligently handles multiple submissions:
- **Overlapping dates**: Merges data at the daily level, preserving all your usage history
- **Non-overlapping dates**: Adds to your profile without affecting existing data
- **Updates**: Submit new data anytime - it will merge with existing data without loss

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- A [Convex](https://convex.dev) account
- GitHub OAuth App credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sculptdotfun/viberank.git
cd viberank
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Configure your `.env.local`:
```env
# Convex
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32

# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_ID=your-github-oauth-app-id
GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-oauth-app-secret
```

5. Set up Convex:
```bash
npx convex dev
```

6. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to see the app.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Convex (real-time, serverless)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with GitHub OAuth

## Troubleshooting

### npx viberank not working?

If you encounter issues with `npx viberank`, try:

1. **Clear npx cache**: `npx clear-npx-cache`
2. **Use the latest version explicitly**: `npx viberank@latest`
3. **Install globally** (optional): `npm install -g viberank` then run `viberank`
4. **Check Node version**: Ensure you have Node.js 14 or higher

### Common Issues

- **"Failed to submit data"**: Check that your cc.json file is valid JSON
- **"GitHub username not found"**: Run `git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"`
- **"No usage data found"**: Make sure you've used Claude Code at least once

## API Documentation

### POST /api/submit

Submit usage data programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.viberank.app/api/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-User: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" \
  -d @cc.json
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "submissionId": "...",
  "message": "Successfully submitted data for username",
  "profileUrl": "https://viberank.app/profile/username"
}
```
